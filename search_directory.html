    <h1>Search Directory</h1>

    Lists the files corresponding to a search query inside the given directory.

    <h2>Synopsis</h2>

    <pre>search_directory.py <u>DIRECTORY</u> <u>SEARCH_QUERY</u></pre>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    The program searches for <u>SEARCH_QUERY</u> in each file under <u>DIRECTORY</u>, returning a list of unique file paths.
    A file is said to "match the search query" if it satisfies <b>any</b> of the following conditions:

    <p><blockquote>
        <h3>File name condition</h3>
        The search query is a substring of the file name. For example, a file with path:
        <code>
            /home/candidate/documents/sales_report.txt
        </code>
        has a name <code>sales_report.txt</code> that <b>matches</b> the queries:
        <ul>
            <li>port</li>
            <li>sal</li>
            <li>sales_report</li>
            <li>report</li>
            <li>.txt</li>
        </ul>
        but does <b>not match</b> the queries:
        <ul>
            <li>documents</li>
            <li>candidate</li>
            <li>sales-report</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>File content condition</h3>
        The search query is a substring of the file content. For example, a file whose content is:
        <pre>"This is an example file. Do not delete this example."</pre>
        matches the query "ample", but does not match the query "readme".
    </blockquote></p>

    <h2>Additional Program Behavior</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The search only matches files, not folders.</li>
        <li>The search is case sensitive.</li>
        <li>The search provides a list of files that match the search query, sorted by decreasing number of "query occurrences". The number of "query occurrences" is defined as a sum of two contributions:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of times the search query appears in the file name. Do not count overlapping appearances of the search query. For example, in the filename <code>sales_report_0000.txt</code>, the query "report" occurs once, the query "00" occurs twice, and the query "t" occurs three times.</li>
            <li>The number of times the search query appears in the file content. As in above, do not count overlapping appearances of the search query.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For files with equal number of "query occurrences", they are sorted by ascending lexicographic order of the path.</li>
        <li>The search only supports the case where <u>DIRECTORY</u> contains exclusively ASCII files.</li>
        <li>The search query only supports the following characters: alphanumeric characters (i.e. a-z, A-Z, 0-9), underscores, dashes, and dots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Output</h2>

    If <u>DIRECTORY</u> is an absolute path:
<pre>
    /home/candidate/documents/daily.txt
    /home/candidate/documents/work/2017/summary_report.txt
</pre>

    If <u>DIRECTORY</u> is a relative path:
<pre>
    ./daily.txt
    ./work/2017/summary_report.txt
</pre>
